A blog about my life and gaming.

Over a short lifetime (25 years), much of that being a gamer, I have developed a
perspective on life that I have found helpful in many ways. Recently I have
encountered interest in hearing about it.

Most of the ideas presented are not/will not be revolutionary by any stretch.
Many of these ideas have been explained by personalities such as Day[9], Sirlin,
and so on. More and more, people are being exposed to video games. Similarly,
people more commonly appear in the media declaring the positive effects of video
games. I must say that I do not fully agree with all of these people just
because I believe that games can be useful. I have therefore set out to explain
the case for gaming from a real gamer.

Sincerely,

Daniel Moniz
